### Overview

The California Health and Human Services Agency oversees 12 departments and three offices, employs nearly 34,000 staff and administers a budget of $140 billion. In 2014, when the Agency embarked on a unified process to publicly release its non-confidential data, it had a complex task before it. Successfully launching a portal for its public data required executive leadership, a shared vision across diverse programs, commitment by personnel and public-private partnerships. Almost two years later, the project has succeeded, allowing health advocates, civic technologists, journalists and anyone else to access and use data more easily than ever before.  As a result of its success, the Agency plans to continue the open data program as part of a larger effort to better use information and data inside and outside of government. 

### Federal Response

### California Response

This story begins inside and outside of government. Inside the California Health and Human Services Agency, both people and processes converged: 

*	People: Two departments, the California Department of Public Health and the Office of Statewide Health Planning and Development, are data-rich organizations that already published data in a number of different formats. Key staff in those and other departments, along with the Agency’s Chief Information Officer, had an interest in data sharing across departments and making data more available and transparent.  

*	Process: In 2010 the Agency received a federal Health Information Exchange grant as part of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act. While the grant mainly focused on data sharing among healthcare providers, it also allowed the Agency to focus on internal data sharing to improve services its departments provide to the public.  Their success in creating a health information exchange plan supported a second award in 2012 that they used to examine opportunities for health and human services data sharing and interoperability. This new grant resulted in two outcomes:

<ul><ul>
<li>	The Agency began the process of identifying data internally, where it was housed and in what formats. This created new opportunities for departments to share data with each other.</li><br />

<li>	The Agency identified a governance structure for data, composed of a cross-department committee, which focused on leveraging data to better support the Agency’s mission. This governance structure would prove to be a critical element in the success of the open data program.</li>

</ul></ul>

Outside of government, one foundation played critical roles in bringing this project to fruition: 

*	At the end of 2011, the California Health Care Foundation began a “Free the Data” initiative. As part of that initiative, they sought a partnership with a state agency that would result in greater public engagement with government data. Today, many agencies publish data in charts that are embedded into reports, or offered as downloadable files. In the latter case, either the format or limited descriptions of the data often prevent researchers and community members from analyzing and using the information independently. In contrast, the Free the Data Initiative advocated for “open” data – meaning it has no restrictions on use – is machine-readable and is accessible via an API (Application Programming Interface), a way of publishing data that allows programmers to connect their websites to the data, making updates automatic and use easier.  

As Agency and Foundation staff began to discuss an opportunity for partnership, they looked at a number of opportunities: publishing existing data in more accessible forms, publishing new non-confidential data, securely sharing confidential data across departments and ensuring data from different departments was interoperable. They started focusing on one cornerstone of this larger effort, an initiative to make existing public data more available – to make it open. They believed starting here would create examples underscoring how open data could inform decision making and drive better health outcomes in local communities. They also believed the emerging governance structure would bolster the implementation of an agency-wide open data project; an ideal opportunity to establish data governance. While other government open data projects have focused on a decrease in requests for public records, in interviews with senior leaders at the Health and Human Services Agency, it is clear they believed making more information available to the public was a part of “good government” and would also catalyze more strategic use of data internally, helping departments make better decisions and better serve the public.  While open data may ultimately decrease costs through fewer Public Records Act requests, Agency leaders view that as a good by-product but not the reason for doing it.



As in any organization, senior leadership needed to sign off before an Agency-wide initiative could begin. For the Health and Human Services Agency, that meant the Undersecretary for Budget and Administration needed to agree that this project was worth the staff time and that it would produce useful results. To prepare for the project – and the pitch – the Agency’s Chief Information Officer convened an informal group of data management leaders from several departments. This group strategized about how to gain executive buy-in for the project.  Concurrently, the Foundation also met with senior leadership in the Agency. Despite this planning, the Undersecretary was not initially convinced of the project’s merits. There was a language gap between the project team and the Undersecretary. The departments and the Foundation talked about “open data” and “hacking” – both terms that sound risky to an Agency safeguarding the private health information of millions of people. After some months of discussion, the Undersecretary and the department staff found common language in a framework originally developed by New York State’s Health Department. In New York, the Department had classified data into three tiers: Tier 1 – clearly public data, often already published; Tier 2 – data that might be able to be made public with some review or cleaning; and Tier 3 – private and confidential data that the Department will never make public. The project team made it clear they were only concerned with Tier 1 data in the beginning and Tier 2 data in later stages. The Agency would never publicly release Tier 3 data. The adoption of this rubric answered the Undersecretary’s major reservations, transforming his skepticism into active support. 

### Past to Present

With executive sponsorship in place, the project began in earnest. The California Health Care Foundation provided a $250,000 grant to cover subscription costs for a service to host the data and provide data visualizations, charts, graphs and other tools that the public could use to understand the data.  This allowed the Agency team, composed of staff from different departments and the Office of the Secretary, to focus on the process rather than the technology. The team could have launched the project after only moving datasets that were already available in Excel or PDF into the portal. They did not do this because the ultimate goal was to put in place a structure accommodating both open data publishing and secure data sharing between departments. Instead, to accomplish this, the team transformed the data into machine-readable formats and created a robust process that included data review by the governance team. 

The leadership team did not have to start from scratch. Open Data initiatives are expanding across the country. In New York, the state’s health agency created a handbook for their initiative. The California team built off this handbook, customizing it for their needs. Such cross collaboration is popular throughout the open data movement. If an organization is starting a new initiative, it’s likely they can borrow and build off of what another city or state has done. 

### Response

Once procedures were in place, the team was ready to begin publishing datasets. One department needed to pilot the project; their datasets would test the process and the governance structure. The California Department of Public Health, whose staff had served on the leadership team and had invested significant time in drafting the handbook, volunteered to pilot the project. This made sense – the department was data rich, which resulted in a department culture that valued the project. The department also had the knowledge and abilities to react nimbly when inevitable issues arose during implementation. The Department of Public Health is large – approximately 3,500 staff – which allowed it to respond with the skilled resources required to clean and reformat the data. Finally, choosing Public Health was an important way to acknowledge the departmental resources it had already invested in the project.
