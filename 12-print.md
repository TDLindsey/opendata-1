# Introduction

Governments around the world are making data more accessible and more useable. By doing so, they are helping to make government more open, transparent and accountable. With open data, community members, local organizations, businesses and journalists can leverage public information to support new businesses, inform public policy, make fact-based decisions, and encourage greater civic engagement.

### Licensing and Terms of Service

When releasing data to the public, many agencies decide to apply formal terms of service and licensing rules to their portals. In these cases, portals either require users to explicitly agree to the terms and rules or they rely on implied consent. The California Health and Human Services portal relies on implied consent. Anyone may view data on the site, but the terms of service require that any “reuse, publication, and/or distribution” of data must include an attribution back to the department that published the data. The terms of service also outline the Agency’s acceptable use policy and includes clauses on limitation of liability and indemnification. The State Controller’s Office, which often posts data from local governments, includes statements that the information is “posted as submitted by the reporting entity” and notes that it does not take responsibility for accuracy of data provided by other entities. The Controller’s Office lists this information on the bottom of their open data site pages and also does not ask for users’ consent prior to accessing data. Other agencies, for example the Board of Equalization and the Franchise Tax Board, require users to explicitly agree to their terms of service before viewing the data on the portal. Each agency publishing data will need to decide how they will approach this issue. The [Open Data Commons](http://opendatacommons.org/licenses/) provides several licensing options that agencies may consider as a starting place.
